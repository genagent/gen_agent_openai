defmodule GenAgent.Backends.OpenAIIntegrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  End-to-end tests that drive a real `GenAgent` process with the
  OpenAI backend but with the HTTP call stubbed via an injected
  `http_fn`. This exercises the full state-machine path through an
  HTTP-shaped backend, not just the backend in isolation.

  The critical invariant under test: the server-side
  `previous_response_id` thread survives across turns, specifically
  that `update_session/2` is called with the terminal `:result`
  event's `response_id` and the next `prompt/2` reads it back.
